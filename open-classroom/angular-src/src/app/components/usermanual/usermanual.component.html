    For a student, finding the ideal place to study can be a reoccurring issue.
    With the inception of OpenClassroom, our goal is to minimize students' already
    high stress levels by a simple solution to finding optimal classrooms to study in.
    Our application will be able to search for classrooms based on a specific time,
    a specific building, or by a "now" function that will list all available classrooms
    that are open at the time of query.
