      For a student, finding the ideal place to study can be a reoccurring issue.
      With the inception of OpenClassroom, our goal is to minimize students' already
      high stress levels by a simple solution to finding optimal classrooms to study in.
      Our application will be able to search for classrooms based on a specific time,
      a specific building, or by a "now" function that will list all available classrooms
      that are open at the time of query.
