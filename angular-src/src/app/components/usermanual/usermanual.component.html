      <h2> Overview </h2>
      <p class= "tab">
        For a student, finding the ideal place to study can be a reoccurring issue.
        With the inception of OpenClassroom, our goal is to minimize students' already
        high stress levels by a simple solution to finding optimal classrooms to study in.
        Our application will be able to search for classrooms based on a specific time,
        a specific building, or by a "now" function that will list all available classrooms
        that are open at the time of query.
